In this project, our Arduino NANO reads information from an MPU-6050 IMU and lights up a RGB LED accordingly. Utilizes the
Wire Arduino library to read from and write to registers.

- Red LED responds to changes in X-Axis 
- Blue LED responds to changes in Y-Axis
- Green LED responds to changes in Z-Axis
