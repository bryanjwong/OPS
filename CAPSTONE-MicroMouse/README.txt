This project is the culmination of the OPS program. Design, code, and build an autonomous robot that can navigate a newly 
encountered maze.

Features:
- Powered by an Arduino NANO
- Uses 3 IR Emitter/Receiver Sensors and PID control system to correct against wall collision
- Custom-designed PCB using Autodesk Eagle software
- IR Sensor-aided turns
- Plays celebratory music upon maze completion :)

Notes:
- Achieved the fastest time of any team at the OPS Capstone Competition
